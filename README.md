# Drums... A love story.

Ever since I was a kid, I loved seeing the drum configurations of my favorite drummers. I would find them online or in Modern Drummer magazine and meticulously scrutinize every piece. Many years later, I decided to make my own.

This is a pretty simple design, but it really is reminiscent of the diagrams from my youth. I made the drum diagram using [draw.io (diagrams.net)](https://www.drawio.com/). I used basic shapes (squares, circles, lines, etc.) to represent the drums, cymbals, hardware, etc. I kept the ratios by multiplying the inches of the item by 10 and using that as a pixel count. So a 20" cymbal would be 200 px. The design is composed of two layers. The first is the drum set design. The second is the numbers for each item.
